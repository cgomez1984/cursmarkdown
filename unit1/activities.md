# Activities
1.- We have [this laptop charger](http://mco-s1-p.mlstatic.com/cargador-portatil-samsung-original-np300-r480-rv410-n110-18159-MCO20150554362_082014-F.jpg) and you need to order a similar one. What you are really going to buy is a charger that works for multiple laptops, trying to make it of the best possible quality. It details which are the characteristics (voltage, current...) of the new charger to order.

2- We have an office with 7 computers (3 of them portable). On the label on the back of the equipment it says the following: PC's: 230V, 1.5 A and Laptops: 19 V 4 A. Find two UPS's that can handle the load that this equipment supposes. Find a solution with two different types of UPS's, listing the advantages and disadvantages of both solutions.

3- Access the page [http://www.apc.com/tools/ups\_selector/index.cfm](http://www.apc.com/tools/ups_selector/index.cfm) web\] and calculate the power consumed by the PC you use, list the components you have configured.

4- We have a computer that controls city traffic (traffic lights, emergencies,...) we know that it consumes a maximum of 200W. What kind of UPS would you use? How much power will be needed?

5- We have a computer at home, we know that on average there are two 10-minute power cuts a year, it consumes a maximum of 450W. What UPS would you use? What power will be needed?

6.- In the workshop, prepare a file describing the characteristics of three power supplies (brand, model) and their status (correct, defective -listing the defect-, does not start).

7-We have a team whose label on the back of the team indicates: 700W and 2A. Calculate the <sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">estimated S</font></sub>

8-We have a team whose label on the back of the team indicates: 4A. Calculate the <sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">estimated S</font></sub>

9-We have a team whose label on the back of the team indicates: 500W. Calculate the <sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">estimated S</font></sub>

10-We have a team whose label on the back of the team indicates: 700W, 2A and efficiency of the source 95%. Calculate the <sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">estimated S</font></sub>

11-We have a team whose label on the back of the team indicates: 4A and efficiency of the source 86%. Calculate the <sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">estimated S</font></sub>

12-We have a team whose label on the back of the team indicates: 500W and efficiency of the source 84%. Calculate the <sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">estimated S</font></sub>
