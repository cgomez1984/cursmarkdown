Electrical disturbances The low-voltage electrical distribution network presents a quality voltage wave that could be disturbed, very occasionally, by faults in the lines and transformation centers, maneuvers, as well as mainly by atmospheric electrical discharges. Users subject the network to the influence of a multitude of loads that, even if they function correctly, can alter the voltage wave with excessive permanent or transient drops, among other disturbances. In addition, the loads can break down and produce abnormal consumption and short circuits that must be isolated by the protection systems. As long as the faulty load is not isolated, it can cause important disturbances in the nearby points of the network. Computer power systems Introduction.

It is called active power ( P ). It is measured in watts ( W ) and the power not used by the computer but that has been generated in the power supply due to the formation of the electric and magnetic fields of its components. Called reactive power ( Q ), it is measured in reactive volt-amperes (var). The apparent power ( S ), is measured in VA (volt-amperes) which is a vectorial sum of the powers (P and Q), somewhat complex to calculate, it can be calculated with the efficiency value (%) of the power supply and its rated power (W). There are various procedures depending on the data we have. On the other hand, in alternating current it is very easy to know the apparent power if we know the intensity consumed by a device, simply apparent power = Intensity * network voltage, that is, S = I * 230 . Procedures for calculation As always, we have always known data: 230V , which is the official voltage value of Spain. All procedures include S calculated is the apparent power needed to run the computer, but only the computer . As the computer has other peripherals (monitor, external drives, printer,...), it is necessary to estimate a safety margin for the electrical consumption of these peripherals.

In a Double Conversion UPS, the batteries are always connected to the inverter . When power loss occurs, the rectifier simply falls out of circuit and the batteries maintain constant, unchanged power. When power is restored, the rectifier resumes carrying the bulk of the load and begins charging the batteries. The main advantage of Double Conversion UPSs is their ability to provide total isolation of the load from the mains. It is the most used for cargo protection.
